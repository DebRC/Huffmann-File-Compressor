* Each character is assigned a unique variable length binary code, instead of its 8-bit representation, with more frequent characters having smaller codes. A Huffman Tree is created and stored to generate and decode these codes.
* Compression ratio usually improves as the file size increases.
* The website is made responsive (with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap) and interactive (with JavaScript ).
